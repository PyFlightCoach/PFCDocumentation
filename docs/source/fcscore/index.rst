FCScore
=======


FCScore is a tool for automatic judging of precision aerobatic competitions. It consists of a server and a client. The server is a 
stateless Flask API, which provides access to tools written in the pyflightcoach libraries. The client is written using SvelteKit.
At the moment the easiest way to run FCScore is with Docker, but we hope to release it as a web app at some point.
A changelog is maintained in the GitHub repo: https://github.com/PyFlightCoach/FCScore/blob/main/changelog.md.
