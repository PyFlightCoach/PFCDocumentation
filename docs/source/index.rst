PyFlightCoach Documentation
===================================

**PyflightCoach** is a collection of packages for working with flight data, principally aimed at plotting and 
analysing precision aerobatics, but many of the tools are useful for other applications. The project was started
to facilitate automatic judging for precision aerobatic competitions and the documentation is split in two parts, 
the first is for competitors and judges who are interested in how the criteria has been implemented, the second
is for developers who want to use the tools for their own projects.



.. note::

   This project is under active development and the documentation has only just been started. If you would like to 
   contribute to the documentation please submit a pull request here: https://github.com/PyFlightCoach/PFCDocumentation
