PyFlightCoach Documentation
===================================

**PyflightCoach** is a collection of packages for working with flight data, principally aimed at plotting and 
analysing precision aerobatics, but many of the tools are useful for other applications. The project was started
to facilitate automatic judging for precision aerobatic competitions. 

The documentation is split into two parts, the first describes FCScore, which is a web app built on top of 
the PyFlightCoach packages for people to analyse their own flights. The second part describes the packages
themselves.
